DB schema creation and migrations

Login to mongoDB cloud and then create a database project and then create a database cluster in the project. While creating we have to provide username and password for the project. After creating a cluster connect it to your node.js project.

```connect-> connect to cluster -> connect to your application -> drivers ->  Select your driver  as Node.js -> Add your connection string into your application code -> copy the connect string
 (example - mongodb+srv://<user-name>:<password>@<cluster-name>.am1c5a5.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority)```
